## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on various features. The project uses a dataset of loan applications and various machine learning techniques to achieve accurate predictions.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fvthima/loan-approval-prediction.git
```

```bash
cd loan-approval-prediction
```

```bash
jupyter notebook Loan_Approval_Pred_Model.ipynb
```

```bash
python app.py
```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is included in the repository as `loan_approval_dataset.csv`. It contains various features such as applicant income, loan amount, loan term, credit history, and more.

## Model
The model training and evaluation are performed in the Jupyter notebook `Loan_Approval_Pred_Model.ipynb`. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Results
The results of the model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics, are documented in the Jupyter notebook. Visualizations of the data and the model's performance are also included.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes.
